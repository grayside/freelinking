# Freelinking

This is code is intended as the next Alpha release of Freelinking 3.x. It is a ground-up rewrite, but since the intended 
functionality is the same as what currently exists in 3.x, the branch is not incremented.

More README coming soon, probably copied from the existing one.

## NOT FUNCTIONING
Note that this code is not functioning. Not only is it probably buggy six ways from Tuesday, it doesn't have fully implemented 
plugins!
